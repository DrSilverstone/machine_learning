Here is some short overview about my work on this competition

It's one of the most interesting cases on Kaggle, IMHO.

Predict the category of crimes that occurred in the city by the bay.

From 1934 to 1963, San Francisco was infamous for housing some of the world's
most notorious criminals on the inescapable island of Alcatraz.

Today, the city is known more for its tech scene than its criminal past. But,
with rising wealth inequality, housing shortages, and a proliferation of expensive
digital toys riding BART to work, there is no scarcity of crime in the city by the bay.

From Sunset to SOMA, and Marina to Excelsior, this competition's dataset provides
nearly 12 years of crime reports from across all of San Francisco's neighborhoods.
Given time and location, you must predict the category of crime that occurred.

We're also encouraging you to explore the dataset visually. What can we learn
about the city through visualizations like this Top Crimes Map? The top most
up-voted scripts from this competition will receive official Kaggle swag as prizes.

Main idea is to predict crime, which probably can occur in at given place,
at given point in time.

It's so real data, any citizen cares about it, any one think about it, and anybody
has own opinion. So, here in this competition I can take this data and try to think,
and more importantly check all my ideas. Awesome!


Main idea - to take this data clean out bad data, or fix it, if it's possible.
Build some new data from given ones, and put it all together into some model.
